# CMU-DO-sample
A structured Todo list for students. Built for the CMU Academic Development as a supplemental tool to their one on one tutoring.

Run locally with `meteor run`

This version is forked from the original repo. I'm using it to deploy a sample version of CMU-DO that doesn't require logging in or out.
